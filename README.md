## Overall description
OPS-Deploy is a complex software composed by a set of Puppet scripts, a task orchestrator (Astute [3]) and a UI. Its goal is to provide a deployment tool for deploying a new FIWARE Lab node based on OpenStack. The tool has a double advantage: support an infrastructure owner to set up a new node more easily and fastly and install a more consistent node into FIWARE Lab federation.
