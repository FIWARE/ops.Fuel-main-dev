custom.mk
---------

To build the project without passing tons of variables from the
command line and without modifying and commiting config.mk you can set
custom variable into custom.mk.  This file will be included if
available by the Makefile and ingored by git.

You may want to start the customization from the
custom-itbox-example.mk
